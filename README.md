# README Generator



## Description
This project creates unique README files based on the input of the user, saving time and the need for tedious repetition. During the creation of this project, I learned how to utilize javascript to create personalized files, which I can see being useful for large projects, or where you would like to use a simple command to create a default file to help setup.
